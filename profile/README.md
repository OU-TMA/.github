# *Unofficial* Open University Tutor Marked Assignments LaTeX templates

**Official version available from OU**: You can find a TMA.sty published by the Open University at [Suggested style for TMAs produced with LaTeX](https://learn2.open.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=206217&cmid=1363808#module-1363817) and in the [OUSA LaTeX forum](https://learn1.open.ac.uk/mod/forumng/discuss.php?d=5940). 

Note that the former says: *You don't have to use this to produce a TMA in LaTeX, but it may help you to get started with a nice output.*

The 2016 github version here is the same one, but since it was uploaded there, the OU has added it to its official site.
